<!--  This is the default user schema. Feel free to modify it to your liking. This schema follows all rules and restrictions as all other schemas, as do the documents (users) created out of it. However, it imposes the following restrictions of its own: 1. The five default fields (groups, name, login, password and locale) are required. 2. This schema cannot be deleted.  Additionally, since this schema is used for user management, the following ACLs are set by default upon creation of each new user document: - document.readACL = login, creator - document.writeACL = login, creator - deleteACL = nobody - requiredVisibles.readACL = login, creator - requiredEditables.readACL = login, creator - requiredEditables.writeACL = login, creator  You can specify your own ACLs upon user creation by passing them as parameters to the SaveUser API as described in the documentation. --> <schema>   <aclGroups>     <aclGroup name="requiredVisibles">       <read>creator</read>       <write>nobody</write>       <fields>         <field>login</field>         <field>groups</field>       </fields>     </aclGroup>     <aclGroup name="requiredEditables">       <read>creator</read>       <write>creator</write>       <fields>         <field>name</field>         <field>password</field>         <field>locale</field>       </fields>     </aclGroup>     <defaultAcl>       <read>creator</read>       <write>creator</write>     </defaultAcl>     <schemaAcl>       <read>creator</read>       <write>creator</write>       <delete>nobody</delete>     </schemaAcl>   </aclGroups>   <fields>     <field name="login" type="string"/>     <field name="name" type="string"/>     <field name="groups" type="string"/>     <field name="password" type="string" />     <field name="locale" type="string" />   </fields> </schema>
